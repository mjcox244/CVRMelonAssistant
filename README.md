CVR Melon Assistant is a PC mod installer for ChilloutVR. It uses mods published in [CVR Modding discord](https://discord.gg/6mGW6yvAkZ).  
It's a Double fork, [VRC MelonAssistent](https://github.com/knah/VRCMelonAssistant) being our direct upline 

**Unlike VRChat, Chillout is happy with users createing non malicious mods that do not harm the experience of others. (no ban risk here)

## Features

CVR has the same feature set as VRC Melon, some of which include:
* Installed mod detection
* Mod uninstallation
* Broken mod move-aside (temporarily uninstalls them until a fix is available)
* Complex theming engine
* Headpats and Hugs

## Usage
Download the newest build from the release section and run it. This application auto-updates when launched, there is no need to download a new release each time.  
Then, simply check off the mods that you wish to install or update and click the <kbd>Install or Update</kbd> button. Likewise, click the <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button to remove any mods.


## Themes
CVR Melon Assistant should support themes for Mod Assistant. Check [its README](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant#themes) for more info on theming.  
However, this is not a supported feature. If something doesn't work, don't complain to either Assistant or knah.

## Common Issues
**I hit install but I don't see anything in game!**
  Double check that you followed the [Usage](#usage) instructions correctly.  
  Make sure you're looking in the right place. Sometimes mod menus move as modding libraries/practices change.  
  Additionally, make sure the proper ChilloutVR installation directory is selected in option tab.
  
**I don't see a certain mod in the mods list!**
  ChilloutVR Melon Assistant uses mods from ChilloutVR Modding Group and shows whatever is available for download.  
  You can ask mod author to submit their mod for review to be included in the list. 
  
**I hit install but now my game won't launch, I can't click any buttons, I only see a black screen, etc**
  Please visit the [ChilloutVR Modding Group](https://discord.gg/xE7AwSrn) `#help-and-support` channel. Check the pinned messages or ask for help and see if you can work out things out.
